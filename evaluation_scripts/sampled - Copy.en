Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation). if the specified collection is also a set, this operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the <i>asymmetric set difference</i> of the two sets. <p>this implementation determines which is the smaller of this set and the specified collection, by invoking the <tt>size</tt> method on each. if this set has fewer elements, then the implementation iterates over this set, checking each element returned by the iterator in turn to see if it is contained in the specified collection. if it is so contained, it is removed from this set with the iterator\'s <tt>remove</tt> method. if the specified collection has fewer elements, then the implementation iterates over the specified collection, removing from this set each element returned by the iterator, using this set\'s <tt>remove</tt> method. <p>note that this implementation will throw an <tt>unsupportedoperationexception</tt> if the iterator returned by the <tt>iterator</tt> method does not implement the <tt>remove</tt> method.
